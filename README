RingCurrent is a utility code provided in both R and Fortran95+ languages to calculate the ring current geometric parameters (Pople and Haigh-Mallion) at the point specified near a conjugated ring, by supplying the Cartesian coordinates of both the query point and the positions of the ring (5- or 6-membered) atoms.

Please cite the following paper when using the code:
